Super early version of this mod. It's goal is to change the probability of each item and item spawn to the same value, and then crank loot through the roof. This will result in rare spawns, like keys, ledx, armor, backpacks, flash drives, and more to spawn almost every raid.

This will likely affect performance. More loose loot on the ground is more stuff for your PC to track. I can't guarantee that your 486 will be able to run SPT with this mod.

Interchange, Lighthouse, and Factory (day and night) refuse to load if every spawnpoint has it's probability set to 1. As a workaround, 9 out of 10 have the probability set to 1, the rest are 0.999999999. You probably won't notice a difference, but it still causes me anxiety.

What is this doing that SVM doesn't?:
In SVM you can set loot multipliers. This sets loot probability. This means that spawnpoints that rarely spawn basically always spawn. And items that spawn in those spawnpoints all have an equal chance of spawning. This means more rare loot, and more loot overall.

Make sure this loads last. Or at least later than anything else that modifies loot spawns. It should be compatible with everything, but it's impossible to test every mod for compatibility.

Possible bugs:
I've tested Interchange, Lighthouse and Factory multiple times. It may stil break on other people's setups. Other maps may break too. I am still trying to nail down what is causing the server crashes.

To Do:
Change the randomized probability for the 9/10 system. Right now it's static, I want it to make the 1/10 a random spawn every raid. right now it's static. You should still see insane loot every raid.
